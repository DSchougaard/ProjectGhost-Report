\chapter{Acknowledgements}
	I would like to dedicate this thesis to my late father, Peter, without whom I would not be here today. He is the one responsible for sparking the interest in computer science when I was a kid. He is the one who kept encouraging me to tinker and toy with computers as I grew older. He is the one who encouraged and inspired me to continue, despite everything.

	My only regret is that he is not with us today, to witness the completion of his dream for me. I only hope that he would have been proud.
