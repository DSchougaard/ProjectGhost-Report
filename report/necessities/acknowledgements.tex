\chapter{Acknowledgements}
	I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor Nicola Dragoni for his remarks, comments, and advice during the process of the thesis. Furthermore I would like to thank Sofie Andrea LÃ¸we for her assistance in proof reading the thesis, on several occasions. I would also like to thank Mathias Larsen for technical feedback.

	Finally I would like to thank my family, without whose support during the project, I surely would have failed.
