\chapter{Summary (English)}
	In this thesis, brief arguments are presented as to why it is beneficial for individuals to host their own password manager, in a private-cloud. Having argued for this, a list of requirements for such an solution was devised. As a follow-up to these requirements, a thorough analysis was conducted. The analysis covered \emph{both} commercially available tools, \emph{and} theoretical academic solutions. The results showed that no such solution exists, which adheres to every requirement, at this point in time. As a consequence, a \emph{new} and improved design is proposed, adhering to \emph{all} of the requirements previously stated. Based on this extensive design, a prototype was implemented. Rudimentary benchmarking was performed on this prototype, to -- amongst others -- determine the viability of running the prototype on low-powered devices. Finally, the risks of using this prototype were discussed, and it was concluded that despite the inherent risks involved, it would still be beneficial to use the prototype.
