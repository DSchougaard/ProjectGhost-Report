\chapter{Conclusion}
	In this thesis, the need for a self-hosted password manager, in the private cloud was argued for and a list of requirements where established. A thorough investigation of available commercial tools and academic solutions were reviewed, and it was found that \emph{none} of the solutions sufficiently fulfilled \emph{all} of the requirements.

	As a response to these findings, a \emph{new} and improved design for a self-hostable password manager is proposed. The design utilizes pseudo-zero-knowledge, to ensure the users' passwords remain their own. A prototype implementation was developed, and is working to the point where it can be called a minimal viable product. As covered, there \emph{are} risks involved with running this solution, however it is concluded that the benefits far outweigh the risks. Finally, the benchmarking revealed that while the performance is \emph{horrible}, it is \emph{feasible} to host the implementation on a Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+. It is suspected, that using a newer and more powerful model, will in fact improve this.
