\chapter{Implementation: The Approach}
	Before describing the actual implementation, it is important to describe the process behind it. While this project \emph{is} comparatively small, the main principles of agile development were used. The overall implementation method was iterative: First and foremost, a \emph{very} basic prototype was implemented. This supported nothing more than user authentication, password storage, and password retrieval. The rest of the features were added one by one, until the final prototype was complete.
