	\section{Developing for the Browser}
		When developing for the browser, there are three ``possibilities'': JavaScript, Java applets, and Flash. However, from a technological point of view, Flash is horribly outdated. The usage of the Flash plugin has simply declined so much, that it is no longer feasible. Using Java applets are, similarly to Flash, simply outdated. Introducing too many security concerns, issues, and cross-platform issues, this is simply not a good choice.

		This leaves us with JavaScript. This \emph{is} the language that pretty much all interactive web applications are developed today. As such, it is what will be used for this project.
